# NASA_astronauts-data-analysis
I analyzed NASA astronauts using Python and MySQL, uncovering insights into demographics, careers, and achievements through descriptive statistics and data visualization. The dataset included names, birthdates, gender, education, military history, and space missions.
This project uses Python and SQLite to analyze NASA astronaut data. The data includes information such as astronauts' names, birthdates, gender, education, military history, space missions, and more.

The project begins by cleaning the data. This involves removing any missing values and correcting any errors in the data.

Next, the project explores the data. This is done by generating descriptive statistics and data visualizations. The descriptive statistics provide information such as the average age of astronauts, the number of astronauts from each country, and the number of astronauts who have served in the military. The data visualizations include bar charts, line charts, and histograms.

The project then uses SQL to answer specific questions about the data. For example, the project uses SQL to determine the average life expectancy of astronauts, the number of female astronauts with undergraduate degrees, and the number of space flights by astronauts from each state.

Finally, the project uses Python to generate insights from the data. For example, the project uses Python to identify the most common undergraduate majors among astronauts and to compare the number of space flights and space walks by gender.

The project is a good example of how Python and SQLite can be used to analyze data and generate insights. The project is well-organized and easy to understand. The code is well-written and documented. The project is also reproducible. Any other researcher can use the code and data to reproduce the results of the project.
